*Update 2020-10-01: This guide has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. This is because, in my opinion, a better guide has been released (by Michael Flaxman). You can find that guide at https://btcguide.github.io/ 

The Hodl-Guide v2.0 has moved to GitHub Pages:

https://driftwoodpalace.github.io/Hodl-Guide/

This repository contains all sources and is used for Issue tracking.

You can find version 1.0 of the guide at https://github.com/DriftwoodPalace/guides/
